Cortex supports the use of TOML, YAML, JSON and env variables for configuration.

This is how the default configuration looks like:

```toml
port = 3030
demo = false

[elastic]
url = "http://localhost:9200"

[ui]
colorscheme = "neon"
[ui.flow.node]
color_attribute = "storage_type"
attributes = ["availability_zone"]
[ui.flow.edge]
attributes = ["storage_type", "availability_zone"]
```

## Using Environment Variables
Cortex supports the use of environment variables for configuration. The environment variables should be prefixed with `CORTEX_` and use `_` as a separator for nested keys. For example, the `port` key in the configuration file can be set using the `CORTEX_PORT` environment variable.

## General Configuration

- `port`: The port on which the Cortex server will listen.
- `demo`: If set to `true`, the server will load a demo dataset on startup.

## Elastic Configuration

- `url`: The URL of the Elasticsearch instance to connect to.  
Currently only non-secured connections are supported. We recommend running a reverse proxy in front of Elasticsearch to secure the connection!

## UI Configuration

- `colorscheme`: The colorscheme to use for the UI. Currently only `neon` is supported.

### Flow Configuration

One of cortex's killer features is the flow view. The flow view visualizes relocating shards between nodes in an Elasticsearch cluster. The flow view can be configured using the
following keys:

- `color_attribute`: The attribute to use for coloring the nodes in the flow view. For example, if you want to color the nodes by `storage_type`, set this to `storage_type`.
- `attributes`: The attributes to show in the node details in the flow view. For example, if you want to show the how which availability zone a node is in, set this to `["availability_zone"]`.
